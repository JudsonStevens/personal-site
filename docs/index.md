# Welcome to the Warren

This site is a work in progress. Check out the links to the left to see what I'm working on.

## Book Reviews and Discussion

I started my software development career after attending the [Turing School of Software and Design][1] where the focus was on getting new developers ready to hit the ground running at a job as quickly as possible. With only 24 hours in a day, it's hard to cover much of the fundamentals of software engineering. You can read more about my experience at Turing [here][5]. 

When I began my first job, I realized that there was a lot I still had to learn about architecture, writing performant code, and the tradeoffs that that come with just about every decision you make designing software ([or that there is even a formalized method to explore those tradeoffs!][2]). It took a while before I started to address this lack of knowledge - settling into a new job in a new career field is an interesting experience all unto itself. 

Part of the solution to address my dearth of knowledge included figuring out what some of the more highly respected books in the field were. While I had been following the [Coding Horror][3] blog since college (and had read some of Jeff Atwood's [recommended books][4]), I hadn't really gotten exposure to books that were specific to software engineering design and philosophy. These articles are the result of my attempt to remedy that lack of knowledge. If you continue reading, you'll find my attempts to digest what I've read and hopefully put the result into something coherent.

## About the Name

The Warren is a reference to one of my favorite book series of all time, [Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen][20]. Let me echo the common refrain across the internet - if you can make it through the first book [Gardens of the Moon][21] with your interest intact, you'll love the rest of the series. I try to re-read it every year or two, and it's like getting back in touch with old friends.
