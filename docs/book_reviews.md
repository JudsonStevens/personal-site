# Book Reviews and Discussions
I started my software development career after attending the [Turing School of Software and Design][1] where the focus was on getting new developers ready to hit the ground running at a job as quickly as possible. With only 24 hours in a day, it's hard to cover much of the fundamentals of software engineering. You can read more about my experience at Turing [here][7]. 

When I began my first job, I realized that there was a lot I didn't know about architecture, writing performant code, and the tradeoffs that that come with just about every decision you make designing software ([or that there is even a formalized method to explore those tradeoffs!][2]). It took a while before I started to address this lack of knowledge - settling into a new job in a new career field is an interesting experience all unto itself. 

Part of the solution to address my dearth of knowledge included figuring out what some of the more highly respected books in the field were. While I had been following the [Coding Horror][3] blog since college (and had read some of Jeff Atwood's [recommended books][4]), I hadn't really gotten exposure to software engineering specific books. These articles are the result of my attempt to remedy that lack of knowledge. If you continue reading, you'll find my attempts to digest what I've read and hopefully put the result into something coherent.

## Domain Driven Design *Quickly*

I decided to start with [Domain Driven Design *Quickly*][5] (DDDQ). This is a shorter version of the book [Domain Driven Design][6]. The free PDF of DDDQ was put together by InfoQ. The company I work for uses a lot of these concepts and they have broad appeal over most enterprise software.

1. [Chapters 1 and 2][8]
    1. What is Domain-Driven Design?
    2. The Ubiquitous Language
2. [Chapter 3][9]
    1. Model-Driven Design
3. [Chapters 4 and 5][10]
    1. Refactoring Towards Deeper Insight
    2. Preserving Model Integrity
